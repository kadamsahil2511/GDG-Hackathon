On a flat Earth, gravity would pull everything towards the center of the plane, making it difficult to walk or for water to stay level. (IFLScience.com, GeolSoc.org.uk)\n*   **Time Zones:** Different time zones exist because different parts of the Earth are facing the sun at different times. This wouldn't be possible on a flat Earth.

(Space.com)\n*   **Scientific Consensus:** The scientific community overwhelmingly supports the spherical Earth model.

The following points are based on the provided sources:\n\n*   **Extinction of Non-Avian Dinosaurs:** The majority of dinosaurs, specifically the non-avian dinosaurs, went extinct around 66 million years ago during the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event (NHM, Britannica, AMNH, National Geographic, USGS). This extinction was likely caused by a large asteroid impact (National Geographic, Science.org). Fossils confirm this extinction event (SI).\n\n*   **Birds as Avian Dinosaurs:** Scientific consensus identifies birds as the direct descendants of a specific group of dinosaurs, the theropods (UCMP Berkeley, Fossilsplus.com). Birds are considered avian dinosaurs (UCMP Berkeley).\n\n*   **Survival of Avian Dinosaurs:** Some dinosaurs, specifically the ancestors of modern birds, survived the extinction event that killed off other dinosaur species (New Scientist, PNAS, Nature.com). This survival is documented through fossil records and genetic evidence (Science.org, Nature.com).\n\nTherefore, because birds (avian dinosaurs) are still alive today, it's inaccurate to say all dinosaurs are dead. Only non-avian dinosaurs are extinct. Many of the provided sources explicitly state the dinosaur-bird link and the survival of avian dinosaurs."
